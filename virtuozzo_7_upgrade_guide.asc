:doctype: book

Introduction
------------

This guide describes how to upgrade from Virtuozzo 6 to Virtuozzo 7 in both local storage and Virtuozzo Storage scenarios. In brief, you can

[options="compact"]
. upgrade current Virtuozzo 6 hosts by using temporary spare Virtuozzo 6 hosts or
. migrate VMs and containers from current Virtuozzo 6 hosts to new Virtuozzo 7 hosts.

The exact steps to perform differ depending on scenario and are described further in the guide.

Upgrading Virtuozzo 6 with Local Storage
----------------------------------------

This chapter describes how to upgrade to Virtuozzo 7 if you have Virtuozzo 6 hosts with local storage. You can upgrade your current Virtuozzo 6 hosts by using spare hosts or migrate VMs and containers to new Virtuozzo 7 hosts. Apply either method to each host in your Virtuozzo 6 infrastructure.

Upgrading with Spare Virtuozzo 6 Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade by using a spare Virtuozzo 6 host, do the following:

. Update both the Virtuozzo 6 host to be upgraded and the spare host to the latest version. You can do this by running `yum update` on each host.
. Back up all VMs and containers on the Virtuozzo 6 host to be upgraded. You can do this with the `pbackup` tool as described in the _Virtuozzo 6 User's Guide_.
. Temporarily migrate VMs and containers from the Virtuozzo 6 host to be upgraded to the spare Virtuozzo 6 host. You can do this with the `pmigrate` tool as described in the _Virtuozzo 6 User's Guide_.
. Perform a fresh install of Virtuozzo 7 on the Virtuozzo 6 host to be upgraded. For instructions, see the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_.
. Migrate VMs and containers back to the upgraded host from the spare host. For more details, see <<_migrating_vms_and_containers_from_virtuozzo_6_to_virtuozzo_7>>.
. If you store VM and container backups on a Virtuozzo 6 host, move them to a Virtuozzo 7 host as described in <<_restoring_virtuozzo_6_backups_to_virtuozzo_7_hosts>>.

Upgrading by Migrating to New Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade by migrating to a new Virtuozzo 7 host, do the following:

. Update the selected Virtuozzo 6 host (from which you will migrate VMs and containers) to the latest version. You can do this by running `yum update`.
. Back up all VMs and containers on the selected Virtuozzo 6 host. You can do this with the `pbackup` tool.
. Perform a fresh install of Virtuozzo 7 on a different (new) host. For instructions, see the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_.
. Migrate VMs and containers to it from the selected Virtuozzo 6 host. For more details, see <<_migrating_vms_and_containers_from_virtuozzo_6_to_virtuozzo_7>>.
. If you store VM and container backups on a Virtuozzo 6 host, move them to a Virtuozzo 7 host as described in <<_restoring_virtuozzo_6_backups_to_virtuozzo_7_hosts>>.

Upgrading Virtuozzo 6 with Virtuozzo Storage
--------------------------------------------

This chapter describes how to upgrade to Virtuozzo 7 if you have a Virtuozzo Storage cluster based on Virtuozzo 6. You can upgrade by either upgrade the current cluster to Virtuozzo 7 by using spare Virtuozzo 6 hosts or migrate VMs and containers to new a Virtuozzo 7 cluster.

Upgrading with Spare Virtuozzo 6 Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Update all hosts in the cluster based on Virtuozzo 6 to the latest version. You can do this by running `yum update` on each host.
. Choose a host to upgrade in the cluster and migrate VMs and containers from it to other Virtuozzo 6 hosts in the cluster.
. Remove chunk servers from the host:
.. Find out which chunk servers are stored on the host by running +pstorage -c _&lt;cluster_name_&gt; top+ on any cluster host.
.. Initiate removal of chunk servers from the host by running +pstorage -c _&lt;cluster_name_&gt; rm-cs --wait _&lt;CS_ID_&gt;+ for each chunk server on the host.
. Wait until the required chunk servers are removed and Virtuozzo Storage rebuilds. To monitor this process, run +pstorage -c _&lt;cluster_name_&gt; top+ on any cluster host. The status of the chunk servers being removed will become `releasing` and the number of replicas on them will start dwindling. When the number of replicas on a CS reaches zero, the CS will be removed both from the host and the `pstorage top` output. Make sure that no chunk servers are left on the host to be upgraded.
. Perform a fresh install of Virtuozzo 7 on the host. During installation, choose to create a new Virtuozzo Storage cluster. For instructions, see the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_.
. Choose another Virtuozzo 6 host in the old cluster and migrate VMs and containers from it to the new Virtuozzo Storage cluster based on Virtuozzo 7. For details, see <<_migrating_vms_and_containers_from_virtuozzo_6_to_virtuozzo_7>>.
. Perform a fresh install of Virtuozzo 7 on the second host. During installation, choose to join the new Virtuozzo Storage cluster based on Virtuozzo 7. For instructions, see the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_.
. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for the remaining hosts in the old cluster until all Virtuozzo 6 hosts are upgraded to Virtuozzo 7.
. If you store VM and container backups on a Virtuozzo 6 host, move them to a Virtuozzo 7 host as described in <<_restoring_virtuozzo_6_backups_to_virtuozzo_7_hosts>>.

Upgrading by Migrating to a New Virtuozzo Storage Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade by migrating VMs and containers from an old Virtuozzo Storage cluster based on Virtuozzo 6 to a new Virtuozzo Storage cluster based on Virtuozzo 7, do the following:

. Update all hosts in the cluster based on Virtuozzo 6 to the latest version. You can do this by running `yum update` on each host.
. On a different set of hosts, create a new Virtuozzo Storage cluster based on Virtuozzo 7. For instructions, see the _Virtuozzo 7 Installation Guide_.
. Migrate VMs and containers from the old cluster to the new cluster. For more details, see <<_migrating_vms_and_containers_from_virtuozzo_6_to_virtuozzo_7>>.
. If you store VM and container backups on a Virtuozzo 6 host, move them to a Virtuozzo 7 host as described in <<_restoring_virtuozzo_6_backups_to_virtuozzo_7_hosts>>.

Migrating VMs and Containers from Virtuozzo 6 to Virtuozzo 7
------------------------------------------------------------

Virtuozzo 7 supports migration of older Virtuozzo 6 VMs and containers to the Virtuozzo 7 format. During migration, VMs and containers are converted for use with Virtuozzo 7. In particular, VM devices are replaced by those supported in Virtuozzo 7. For a list of VM hardware supported in Virtuozzo 7, see the _Virtuozzo 7 User's Guide_.

To migrate a VM or container from Virtuozzo 6 to Virtuozzo 7, run the following command on the Virtuozzo 6 host.

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl migrate _&lt;VM_or_CT_name_&gt; root@_&lt;VZ7_host_IP_address_&gt;*
----

Migration from Virtuozzo 6 to Virtuozzo 7 implies VM and container downtime that depends on network bandwidth, virtual machine RAM size, and host load. To reduce downtime, it is recommended to at least perform migration when the host load is minimal.


Restoring Virtuozzo 6 Backups to Virtuozzo 7 Hosts
--------------------------------------------------

Virtuozzo 7 supports restoring backups of Virtuozzo 6 VMs and containers to Virtuozzo 7 hosts. This section lists steps for possible scenarios. In each scenario, the commands are run on the Virtuozzo 7 host to which the backups will be restored.

To restore a specific backup stored on a Virtuozzo 6 host, do the following:

. Find out the backup ID by listing backups stored on the Virtuozzo 6 host:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl backup-list root@&lt;VZ6_host_IP_address&gt;*
----

. Restore the backup:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restore -t &lt;backup_ID&gt; root@&lt;VZ6_host_IP_address&gt;*
----

To restore a backup of a Virtuozzo 6 VM or container migrated to a Virtuozzo 7 host, run

[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl restore &lt;VM_or_CT_name&gt; root@&lt;VZ6_host_IP_address&gt;*
----

To copy a Virtuozzo 6 VM or container backup to a Virtuozzo 7 host and restore it there, do the following:

. Find out the backup ID by listing backups stored on the Virtuozzo 6 host:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# prlctl backup-list root@&lt;VZ6_host_IP_address&gt;*
----

. Find out the default backup directory on the Virtuozzo 7 host:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*prlsrvctl info | grep "Backup path"*
----

. Copy backup files to the default backup directory on the Virtuozzo 7 host. For example, if backups are stored in the default directory on a Virtuozzo 6 host, run:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
*# scp -r root@&lt;VZ6_host_IP_address&gt;:/var/parallels/backups/&lt;backup_ID&gt; \
/vz/vmprivate/backups/*
----
+
Or, if you keep backups on network storage, attach said network storage to the default backup directory on the Virtuozzo 7 host. For example, if you store backups on an NFS share, mount this share to `/vz/vmprivate/backups/`.

. Restore the copied backup with either of the previously described methods.
